# Offline-RAG-Chatbot-LangGraph
An offline-first Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) chatbot built using LangGraph. Demonstrates a stateful, multi-step RAG workflow including routing, retrieval grading, answer generation, and hallucination checking. Runs without API keys using dummy responses, making it ideal for demos, learning, evaluation, and future extension to real LLMs.
